### Why this project is good for the ecosystem.

- Ecosystem project incubation
	- By maintaining a close tie with the community while expanding, Polkbase will help identify potential projects on Polkadot and thereby create more application scenarios for the ecosystem.
	- HiveHub, an incubator found by Polkabase’s core members, has already received cooperative intentions from some of the industry’s most illustrious exchanges, VCs and community influencers.
